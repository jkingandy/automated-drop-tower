Here is the control code I developed during my internship in Exactech's engineering lab. I didn't have much coding experience prior to this, but the project motivated me to learn as much as I could to get it working. I took an interest in signal processing and low-level computing during this project, and I successfully applied principles I learned in my control theory classes to create a code that read from several sensors, controlled the movement of an electric motor, recorded the number of cycles completed, and detected several possible errors.
